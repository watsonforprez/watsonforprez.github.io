There we go. I'm Chandler Watson, and I love:

* mathematics, 
* computer science, 
* abstract poetry, 
* playing the piano, 
* long-distance running, 
* my little dog and my little sister, 
* conversations with emotional depth, 
* logical conclusions, 
* and short-but-sweet walks on the beach. 

In case you had no idea, I'm running for Student Body President (SBP). 

## But why you?

100% honesty here, I have a lot of attributes and opinions that aren't classically "presidential." Here are some I've noticed:

* Proofs are always better than gut feelings, but act when necessary
* Data with meaning is always more convincing than rhetorical argument
* Empathize with all parties before - not after - deciding
* I take time and draw diagrams instead of arguing my way to victory 
* Delegation is important, but I'd rather do it myself than make someone else
* I'd always rather discuss with interested individuals than take full credit

Feel free to disagree, but I think those attributes - though certainly not traditional - are essential to proper leadership in any form.

## What would you do?

This is the first question I think you should be asking any candidate. It's easy to make anyone gloss over with superlatives and abstractions, but at heart I am a man of the concrete. 

The following is a list of things I think would be fantastic to implement in the upcoming year. You may like all, some, or none of these - regardless, these are brain food for you to tell me what you want. In the next year, we could...

* Design a Netflix for classes - based on what you liked, it'll suggest classes 
* Fix up the lunch meeting system to prevent conflicts and increase collaboration
* Make a system for digital student petitions, in case you care about something
* Create a platform to suggest students in similar classes for study groups
* Optimize traffic patterns in the morning so you aren't late (math can do that!)
* Improve DataMatch so it figures out you're more than your favorite 90s group 
* Automate voting for student government so it finally *makes sense* (seriously)

If any of these sound appealing, or you've thought of a better idea, email me! You can email me at my school email or <prezwatson2016@gmail.com>, which redirects to the same account.
