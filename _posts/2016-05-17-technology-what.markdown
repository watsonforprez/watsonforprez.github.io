summary:    In this post, I cover why I believe technology is quintessential to a successful presidency of 2016/2017.

After the presidential speeches on Monday - which were, in my opinion, all fantastic - I've received a number of exceptional questions, most of which have had to do with my core belief that technological literacy in the office is paramount to OES in 2016 and 2017. 

The main theme has centered around this - *why such a focus on technology?*

Let's take a little trip into the past. How many times during the presidential speeches this year (and, let's be honest - every year) did you hear a phrase like:

* "Let's make StuCo accountable to the student body" 
* "The opinions of the student body are going unheard"
* "StuCo doesn't do anything - let's have them do X"
* "There's so much we can do, but no one's doing it"

To be completely honest, I'm even guilty of saying phrases such as "unheard voices" in my speech. But in recent years, presidential candidates have completely shifted the blame onto StuCo or entirely ignored the problem by *hedging* on such phrases.

Let me be the first to say it - *give StuCo a break!* These are hard working young adults who put a ton of their personal time and effort into selflessly bettering the school. If you're reading this right now, please thank a StuCo member the next time you see them. Seriously - they do a lot for us.

The issue is that the big picture problems and the ones that are going to be changed by leaving StuCo to fend off attacks don't overlap at all. In other words, pinning down StuCo to "solve" the problem is a waste of time. StuCo was designed to be able to publish legislation in a *methodical, well-paced* manner. The president, much like the national position it was modeled after, is intended to be seperate yet complementary - to act at a more *rapid, experimental pace* and implement such legislation. 

Especially in the modern era, if the president is armed with no more than a pen, he is not seperate neither complementary to StuCo. Indeed, StuCo is excellent at their job - it is simply a fact that we don't need more legislators. We need someone that can interact with StuCo *and* the student body and enact change using their unique capabilities.

A quick note - when I say "technology," I'm not referring to a room full of socially inept individuals punching keys to entertain themselves. I'm referring to the glorious plethora of new ideas that we have seen on the horizon which rapidly approach us *because we seek after them voraciously*. 

I'm not referring to software. I'm referring to art, writing, language, math, science, or literally anything where you create anything. If you're curious what a project might look like, check my [about page](/about/). These are simply ideas - my hope is that they will inspire you to even greater ones.

In short, "technology" is a $2 word for the 50 cent idea of making. This presidency, I hope to build teams. Build projects. Build community. If you elect me, you'll definitely be able to be involved. But not by shouting at StuCo. By using your talents on a team with me.

If we want to make the changes you as an individual want to see, odds are it'll take more than legislation. It will take legislation and elbow grease. If you want to see OES finally break the cycle of "say change and move on?" 

Join me.
