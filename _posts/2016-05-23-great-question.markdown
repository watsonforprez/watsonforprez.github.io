The other day, I received an email asking the following question:

<blockquote>
<p>
What differentiates using technology to advance student government in the role of president and using technology to advance student government not in the role of president? Couldn't you just be running for 'tech consultant' or something similar?
</p>
</blockquote>

This question really was a formative one as I determined my campaign strategy and who I really wanted to be as president. I responded with the following:

<i>
That's a fantastic point. When crafting my positions for my campaign this year, that was something I had to put a lot of thought into. But when I sat down and thought about the changes I could make to the OES community - in fact, changes any president has aimed to make - I realized that none of them entirely required me, or frankly anyone else, being in the role of president. Certainly working with Student Council and leading movements in the community would be far easier and more effective from the office of president, but strictly speaking, I realized that nothing anyone could do in the office of presidency - short of superficial responsibilities such as leading gathering - is impossible outside of the office.
</i>

<i>
In light of this, an extremist might say that the president is a vestigial role which only holds symbolic significance. I would agree that the presidency receives a surprising amount of attention for the power afforded to the office, but I do not believe it is time to get rid of this role - not yet. The beauty of such a powerless role is that it necessitates versatile, intelligent leadership to make it cooperative with and beneficial to the other offices of student government. We have seen this in bits and pieces in previous years, but never to the extent OES can achieve.

In response to the second part of your question, I could totally run as a tech consultant this year and develop some really cool projects on my own. There is nothing in the presidency that would make typing, or thinking, or running statistical tests easier. All the work would take just as long. But tech consultant is only a small part of the job I propose to do in office. My presidency is more than just me sitting alone building things I think are cool - it's me sitting in a room with makers, legislators, and interested peers collaborating and designing changes to the OES community we believe are necessary. Technology is the enzyme to the metabolism of teamwork and talent into results. I don't want to be student body president so I can develop technology - I want to be student body president so we can develop solutions with technologies as tools and conduits that no past president has ever had access to.

I hope this reponse has helped you understand the range of possibility available if I were chosen as president. If you have time, I would love for you to read my other blog posts, as well as my [about page](/about/). These are hugely helpful - essential, in my opinion - to forming an informed opinion for Friday, and I would love to hear your feedback on them.

Thank you!
