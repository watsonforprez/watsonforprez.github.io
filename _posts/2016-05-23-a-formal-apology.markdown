The debates today were, to put it lightly, quite exciting and fast-paced for me. I owe a huge thanks to the wonderful moderators and my fellow candidates for making it such a wonderful time. Nonetheless, I believe I made an undue offense today when I stated that StuCo had not requested any student input via email over the past few years. I sincerely apologize to all members of StuCo at all levels - I understand that student input goes far beyond what is readily perceived by the student body, and want you to know that in all sincerity I respect you devoting your time to the OES community. My comment was not intended as an attack on StuCo, but a recommendation for future work not just from StuCo but also the student body and class president. 

Nonetheless, I recognized that the statement I made was indeed a factual error, and as such I decided to make a proper analysis of the situation. Checking my email history for all emails matching the keyword "StuCo," I swept through all emails I had received requesting student input. This was to act as a heuristic for the frequency of feedback requests. Here is a list of the titles of all of the emails matching this criteria from 2016:

* Student Body Award!!!
* We want your questions for the presidential debate!
* StuCo & DC Candidate Statements--due FRIDAY
* Identity Group Student Leaders
* 2 Mission Group Rep Positions--important info
* Carpool Parking Spot Sign-Up

To ensure I found all possible emails, I searched "policy board" and "community board" as well:

* 2016 Voting Policies
* 2015/2016 Voting Regulation Changes
* Voting Regulations on the Dig
* LAST MINUTE MATCHING <3 <3 <3
* Data-Match!! WOOHOO
* Identity Group Mission Rep Elections
* Semi 2016 Feedback Form
* SEMI REGISTRATION YAY <3
* Minute to Win It!

It should hopefully be obvious to the reader that the emails listed here certainly will not include every possible relevant email. Indeed, from a technical standpoint, internal correlation between those keywords and a set of emails I describe in the following sentences may be coincidentally high. The interested statistican should feel free to contact me, but for an incidental study, the following should suffice.

As I read through the above set of emails, I realized why I thought I hadn't received any StuCo emails requesting my input - except for the emails regarding DataMatch and Semi, most of the input emails I received either addressed voting or running for positions in office. Retrospectively, I noticed that I would often archive these emails subconciously as I knew I wasn't going to run for any other position. This is what really highlighted the dichotomy - at least, for me - of student feeling toward input in StuCo.

In an ideal system, the only manner of input to student government should be through representatives. This prevents discrepancies between internal and external affairs, and in such an ideal system the representatives would be able to perfectly represent the population they represent. For the technically minded in the audience, each representative would essentially be a [multiplexer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplexer). Fortunately, though, we are all human, and as such every system is lossy - there is no such thing as a perfect representative, but especially in light of what a tricky task it is to fully represent a large audience, OES comes exceptionally close. Nonetheless, I believe it could do our school even more good to accumulate statistical results of student opinion regarding various topics - this is analogous to amplifying a low-voltage signal before it enters the multiplexer to minimize loss. Ultimately, the multiplexer (or representative) is what does the heavy lifting - something we frankly should be even more grateful for - but the amplifiers help the multiplexer do its job even more effectively. 

The dichotomy I alluded to earlier is the idea of whether students should be heard in student government directly or through representatives. It's clear that we need representatives - seriously, otherwise we'd lose a number of really nice [properties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voting_system#Experimental_criteria) [about](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condorcet_method) [voting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median_voter_theorem) with people sporadically becoming involved and uninvolved. Nonetheless, I believe that additional work on the student end of things - applying amplifiers to the multiplexer's inputs - certainly could not hurt. Who is responsible for making sure student voices make it as representatively as possible to representatives? I would argue the burden lies *primarily on the students*. Nonetheless, as a student body president, it would not be a terrible idea to make such a process more obvious and convenient - this can only serve to increase student/government unity and improve student involvement. 

Circling back to my statement in my debate, it was not intended to be a remark attacking StuCo or anyone on it - it was a statement that a possible improvement in our community still remains available. I mentioned StuCo only because it is the body containing the representatives so engrained in the process I outlined above - it is connected to the process, but *certainly* not solely responsible for amplifying the student voice. Nonetheless, I again apologize to any that were offended or offput by my remark and want to state that I take full ownership for it.

In light of this, for the wonderfully pragmatic among us, I would like to briefly outline how I would want to work with StuCo in the days to come. I recognize that the duties of the president are not to work as a member of one Board or the other, but instead to create a tripartite bond between the student body and the two Boards. As such, I would make my focus the accumulation and distillation of opinion - to collect and do statistical analysis on the week by week opinions of the student body on everything from the fun and frivolous, like Spirit Week themes, to the strongly pertinent, such as the adoption of an Honor Code. I would then take these analyses, present them to both boards, and actively engage and suggest opinions to catalyze the formation of a single opinion. At this point, I would draft a written report for administration and student body alike describing the evolving process in each board - demonstrating simultaneously how much the boards do and satisfying yearly requests for transparency without inducing radical or damaging changes. As needs arise, I would readily depart from the 10,000 foot view to focus on very specific issues to craft and discuss novel and varied solutions in order to resolve issues in the most appropriate and forward-thinking manner possible. 

I truly hope this helps clarify my opinions on the duties of the student body president as well as expresses my gratitude to the members of Student Council - if you have any additional concerns or ideas you want to discuss, please let me know! 

Thank you for your time! May you all have a wonderful evening :)
