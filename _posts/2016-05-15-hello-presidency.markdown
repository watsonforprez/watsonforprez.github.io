Hello there!

I'm Chandler Watson, and this is my blog for my campaign of 2016. As far as I know, no one's ever done this before - at least, not in this classy of a manner ;)

Odds are, if you're reading this, you just listened to an awesome speech and scanned a giant QR code I was holding up. Let's make this post worth your time.

    The first responsibility of a leader is to define reality. The last is to say thank you. In between, the leader is a servant.

As Student Body President, I hope to serve you - but serve you like no one ever has, <i>or ever will</i>, this presidential season.

## What's the big deal?

As someone who tends to be deferential to others and kind, it may not sound like I have a lot of experience with leadership. In fact, if you know me, I might seem pretty laid back to you. Just for fun, here's a baby resume of my capabilities demonstrating leadership, determination, and bravery:

* Worked at Intel developing visualization software
* Represented OES internationally at ISEF 2016
* Participated in leadership roles in XC and Track for six years
* Was totally "that guy" in class that asked the really long questions 
* Spat fire and won the 2015 OES Mystery Friday rap battle
* Practiced piano and got darn good at it over 10+ years
* Championed OES in more math competitions than I can count
* Wrote a lot of low-grade poetry I keep private but read to friends
* Continuing to work toward an Eagle Scout award
* Extremely proud older brother and absolute dog lover

These are just a few items on the list of things I've done - if you want more (not sure why) or just want to talk about where I want to go this presidential season, stop me in the halls or fire me an email! I respond to my OES email the fastest, so I've setup <prezwatson2016@gmail.com> (available also through the contact page) to forward to that account as well. 

Don't forget to check out my [about page](/about/) - it has a brief outline of my campaign and some of my views on the presidency. Plus, it's just a fun read.

I hope you have a wonderful presidential season - happy voting!
